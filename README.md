# hello-world
My first venture into the world of Github and my Ruby journey. 


My name is Kelsy Rice and I am currently a production artist/ baby graphic designer working in the clothing industry. 
I have a deep interest in learning and want to expand my future horizons with becoming a web developer. 
I hope anyone who reads this will help me and that in some way I can help you too.
